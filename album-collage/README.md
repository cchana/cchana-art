# Album Art Collage

Simply supply an array of your favourite album covers and build a collage of photos.

Album art can be found using Ben Dodson's [iTunes Artwork Finder](https://bendodson.com/projects/itunes-artwork-finder/).

For printing, I have found that using Chrome's 'Screenshot Node' option (open dev tools, press CTRL+P and look for the command) on the <ul> element gives you a large enough graphic you can print.

Designed to be an A5 print at the moment, lengths are generally specified in mm or cm.
